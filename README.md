# NotesApp
This is a basic Note making android application written in Kotlin.
This application enables the user to Create, Read, Update and Delte their notes.
We store the data of the notes using a local database using ROOM Database library.
We have also implemented Co-routines to make the I/O operations quick and smooth so that our app is lag-free.
